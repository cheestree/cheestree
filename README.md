## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel (also known as :cheese:). I'm a **Software Engineer** student, currently in my 4th year.

I mainly code in **Kotlin** (academically and not) but I also have some experience with other **OOP** languages such <br/>
as **C++**, **Java**, **Python**, **Ruby** and **JS**, as well as currently learning **COBOL** for procedural programming.

My hobbies include:
- cooking.
- debugging.
- bugging.
- debugging again.

I also play the piano and spend time at the gym.
