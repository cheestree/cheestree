## Hi there 👋

My name is Daniel (also known as :cheese:). I'm a **Software Engineer** student, currently in the 1st year of my Master's Degree in Software Engineering.

I mainly code in **Kotlin** (academically and not) but I also have some experience with other **OOP** languages such <br/>
as **C++**, **Java**, **Python**, **Ruby** and **JS**. Interested in continuing my **COBOL** studies if time allows it.

My hobbies include (in no specific order):
- cooking.
- debugging.
- bugging.
- debugging again.
- pondering.

I also play the piano and spend time at the gym.
